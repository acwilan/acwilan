# 👋 Hi, I'm Andres (acwilan)

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with over 20 years of experience building reliable, scalable, and developer-friendly systems. My background spans **Java**, **C#**, **PHP**, and modern **JavaScript/TypeScript**, with recent focus on **React** and **Node.js**. I enjoy solving complex problems, mentoring, and designing systems that improve developer productivity.

---

## 💻 What I Do
- **Backend Engineering**: Strong expertise in Java (Spring Boot, RESTEasy, Maven) and experience with microservices, APIs, and fintech/payment systems.  
- **Frontend Development**: Building rich web experiences using React, TypeScript, React Bootstrap, and Tailwind.  
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, automation pipelines, and cloud-native (GCP).  
- **OpenAPI & API-first design**: Generating clients and SDKs, enforcing contracts, and streamlining developer experience.

## 🚀 Projects & Experiments
I love working on side projects that combine creativity with engineering:  
- 🎶 **[ChordBook](https://acwilan.github.io/chordbook/)** – an open-source chord chart site for musicians, with multilingual support.  
- 🎟️ **Blockets** – NFT-backed event ticketing platform (part of **GroundChain** initiative).  
- 🎮 **GameArr** – an *arr-style media manager concept for retro games.  
- 🙌 **EBaL v2** – a worship service planning tool with multi-language support and modern UI/UX.  

I also tinker with home-lab setups (Plex, *arr stack, Raspberry Pi), and automation to make everyday systems smarter.

## 📚 Continuous Learning
I’m always sharpening my skills in areas like:
- **Cloud Native Development** (GCP focus)  
- **Blockchain applications** (NFTs, decentralized identity)  
- **Modern frontend tooling** (React 18, Astro, Gatsby)

## 🎸 Outside of Code
- Passion for **music** (guitarist with electric & acoustic rigs, exploring tone with HX Stomp + MIDI).  
- Interest in gaming classics like **Zelda: Ocarina of Time** and retro emulation.
