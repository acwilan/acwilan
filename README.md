## 💻 What I Do
- **Backend Engineering**: Strong expertise in Java (Spring Boot, RESTEasy, Maven) and experience with microservices, APIs, and fintech/payment systems.  
- **Frontend Development**: Building rich web experiences using React, TypeScript, React Bootstrap, and Tailwind.  
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, automation pipelines, and cloud-native (GCP).  
- **OpenAPI & API-first design**: Generating clients and SDKs, enforcing contracts, and streamlining developer experience.

## 🚀 Projects & Experiments
I love working on side projects that combine creativity with engineering:  
- 🎶 **[ChordBook](https://acwilan.github.io/chordbook/)** – an open-source chord chart site for musicians, with multilingual support.  
- 🎟️ **[Blockets](https://github.com/groundchain/blockets/)** – NFT-backed event ticketing platform (part of **GroundChain** initiative).  
- 🎮 **[GameArr](https://github.com/homeputers/gamearr/)** – an *arr-style media manager concept for retro games.  
- 🙌 **[EBaL v2](https://github.com/homeputers/ebal2)** – a worship service planning tool with multi-language support and modern UI/UX.  

I also tinker with home-lab setups (Plex, *arr stack, Raspberry Pi), and automation to make everyday systems smarter.
